#+TITLE: Python in Doom Emacs
* First Steps
- Run =doom doctor= and look inside the python section to see what executables you lack and install them.
* Config
- Don't forget to uncomment =python= in =init.el=
  - Change enable =lsp= under =:tools= and change =python= to =(python +lsp)= if you're planning to use a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_Server_Protocol][Language Protocol Server]] using [[http://emacs-lsp.github.io/][lsp-mode]].
  - Enable =(company +childframe)= under =:complection= as well.
* Basics
- =M-x run-python= to open a python shell.
  - =python-shell-send-region= or =C-c C-r= to send a selected region to the shell.
  - =python-shell-send-file= or =C-c C-l= to send another file to the shell.
  - =python-shell-send-buffer= or =C-c C-c= to send a selected region to the shell.
* LSP-Mode
- =lsp-update-server= select a language server to update.
- =flycheck-list-errors= to see the errors detected by LSP.
- =lsp-find-definition= to jump to where a symbol has been defined.
- =lsp-find-references= to get list of all the places where a symbol has been used.
- =lsp-rename= to rename a symbol across the file.
* Virtual Environments
- Install virtualenv using =pip install --user --upgrade virtualenv=
- After opening a python file, =pyvenv-create= to create a venv.
- =pyvenv-workon= to activate a venv by selection.
- =pyvenv-activate= to activate a venv from a certain path.
  - Once a venv is activated, =vterm= will open a terminal with that certain environment activated.
- =pyvenv-deactivate= to deactivate a venv.
** TODO pyenv


* Flycheck
- See inside the variable =flycheck-checkers= to see from which software check your code. For python the list includes python-flake8, python-pylint, python-pycompile, python-pyright, and python-mypy.
